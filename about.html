  <h2>What we do</h2>
  <h3>Mission </h3>
  <p>The Energy Community mission is to extend the EU internal energy market to South East Europe and beyond on the basis of a legally binding framework. The principal instrument to achieve this aim is the adoption of the EU legislation, the so-called acquis communautaire, in energy and related areas. To date, some 25 laws have been incorporated into the Energy Communityâ€™s legal framework, covering gas, electricity, security of supply, renewables, oil, energy efficiency, environment, competition and statistics. The Energy Community may also take measures to create a single energy market. 


The Opinions of the Advisory Committee are an integral part of the Energy Community dispute settlement procedure. Before the Ministerial Council decides on determining the existence of a breach by a Party of its obligations under the Energy Community Treaty, the current Presidency and Vice-Presidency are required to ask the Advisory Committee for its Opinion on the dispute settlement case at hand. Upon invitation by the Presidency, the President may appear at the relevant meeting of the Ministerial Council to explain the Opinion delivered by the Advisory Committee.</p>
