  <h3>Energy Community Advisory Committee Ready to support the Energy Community dispute settlement process </h3>
  <p>The Energy Community Advisory Committee, a body of independent legal experts with an advisory function to the Ministerial Council in the dispute settlement process, has adopted its rules of procedure and elected Dr. Wolfgang Urbantschitsch as its President and Dr. Verica Trstenjak as its Vice-President.


The Opinions of the Advisory Committee are an integral part of the Energy Community dispute settlement procedure. Before the Ministerial Council decides on determining the existence of a breach by a Party of its obligations under the Energy Community Treaty, the current Presidency and Vice-Presidency are required to ask the Advisory Committee for its Opinion on the dispute settlement case at hand. Upon invitation by the Presidency, the President may appear at the relevant meeting of the Ministerial Council to explain the Opinion delivered by the Advisory Committee.</p>
